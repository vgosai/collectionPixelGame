Particle System Event Notes
| Method                                  | When itâ€™s called                                         | Requirements                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OnParticleCollision(GameObject other)` | When a particle with collision enabled hits a Collider.  | Particle System **Collision module** enabled, `Send Collision Messages` checked. |
| `OnParticleTrigger()`                   | When particles enter/exit/stay in trigger volumes.       | Particle System **Trigger module** enabled, `Send Trigger Messages` checked.     |
| `OnParticleSystemStopped()`             | When a Particle System finishes emitting and is stopped. | Usually needs `Stop Action = Callback`.                                          |
| `OnParticleSystemPaused()`              | When a Particle System is paused.                        | Rarely used manually.                                                            |
| `OnParticleSystemPlayed()`              | When a Particle System starts playing.                   | Rarely used manually.                                                            |
